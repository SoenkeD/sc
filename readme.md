# SC - State Chart
State Chart is a tool to generate application code based on state charts,
to help solving complex tasks. 
Using state charts in programming many advantages. 
Some of the most important are:
- Easier to understand & serves as a communication basis
- Decouple overall behavior from components
- Scales good with increasing complexity 
- Supports documenting without additional effort

To get more information about state charts (in programming) 
or read about [the concept of sc](docs/concept.md) or
consider visiting [statechart.dev](https://statecharts.dev),
which contains a nice collection of information and explanations 
regarding this topic. 

## Get Started (base)

2. (optional) [Read the documentation](docs/readme.md)

3. Decide on a language on following the the available guides and examples
